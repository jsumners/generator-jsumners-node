# generator-jsumners-node

This is a [Yeoman][yo] generator for kickstarting a [Node][njs] project in
the manner [James Sumners][jsumners] likes to do it.

The resulting project is quite minimal. Just a blank, strict style, main script,
a simple [Mocha][mocha] based test, and a [Gulp] script to verify code style
and run the test(s).

It'll, optionally, create an [IntelliJ IDEA][idea] project as well.
